## Welcome to TeperatUHR
This is a project by [Paul Goldschmidt](https://paul-goldschmidt.de/) which can smartly monitor the temperature of a fluid or a gas and notice you in case a certiain threshold is reached. It will even factor in the way to the sensor - so no energy gets wasted and the measured material just reaches the wanted temperature in the moment you'll arrive.
