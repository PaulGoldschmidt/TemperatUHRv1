## Welcome to TeperatUHR
This is a project by [Paul Goldschmidt](https://paul-goldschmidt.de) which can smartly monitor the temperature of a fluid or a gas and notice you in case a certiain threshold is reached. 

This project was created for the [Paul Award 2020](https://www.paul-award.de/), which is ran by ["Elektronik Neo"](https://www.elektronik-neo.de/) and the [Fachverband Elektronik-Design (FED) e.V.](https://www.fed.de/).
